# mtm6407-frontend-mentor-MichaelVolk94

My Frontend Mentor assignment was based off of the newspage challenge. My overall submission for desktop would look exactly how the example showed. As for the mobile version, it was a huge challenge for me. I kept having trouble with the styling of the code, until I realized I had to use (display: inline-block) in order for the screen to look like what comes out of a mobile app. 

Unfortunatley I struggled making the mobile sidebar. No matter what I did it just would not work and it would stay white on the left side of the screen. However, everything looks almost exactly like the examples I was given. So it won't be too much of a reduction.
